# Intro

This is a feature which will find errors in the usage of different types of brackets.

This feature is implemented using stack abstract data structure in C++.

Basically, user can enter a random string which contains letters, digits, brackets (e.g. []{}()) and other
ASCII code. This feature will automatically detect if brackets are used correctly. If yes, it will output
Success. If no, first output the first unmatched closing bracket. If we can not find unmatched closing bracket,
output the first unmatched opening bracket.

Unit Testing has been conducted and attached to this project.
