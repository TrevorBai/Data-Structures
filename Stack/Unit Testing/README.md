# Intro

Unit Testing is conducted using Microsoft Unit Testing Framework
in Visual Studio.

In order to facilitate the testing, restructuring of check_brackets_Trevor.cpp
has been done. A new class has been created and implemented in a header file.
The output of that class is what we would like to test either "Success" or the
position of certain char. The new created header file can be easilly shared by
main.cpp and unittest1.cpp.

There are 54 tests file uploaded. For extreamly large input test scenario, we will
leave the input in separate file resource and test it using unittest2.cpp.
